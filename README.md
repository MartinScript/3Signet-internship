## Introduction
As part of the **3Signet Internship Program**, I will work on various data science problems and challenges. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work and demonstrates my progress and learnings throughout the internship.

## Technologies
The following tools and libraries will be used in these projects:
- Python (for data manipulation and model building)
- Pandas, NumPy (data analysis)
- Scikit-learn (machine learning algorithms)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (deep learning frameworks)
- Jupyter Notebook (interactive data exploration)

## Projects

### 1. Predictive Modeling
- **Description:** Building a predictive model to forecast key metrics using real-world datasets.
- **Tools/Techniques:** Regression models, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning.

### 2. Statistical Analysis
- **Description:** Conducting exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing to gain insights from data.
- **Tools/Techniques:** Statistical tests, data distributions, p-values.

### 3. Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Description:** Developing and fine-tuning machine learning algorithms to solve classification and regression problems.
- **Tools/Techniques:** Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks.

## Setup and Installation

To run the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MartinScript/3Signet-internship.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 3Signet-Internship-DataScience
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## How to Use
1. Open any project folder and start exploring the notebooks.
2. The notebooks are structured with explanations and code cells, so you can follow along with the analysis.
3. Feel free to experiment with the code by modifying parameters or testing other models.
