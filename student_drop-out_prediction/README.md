## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on building and optimizing machine learning models to predict student dropout rates in educational institutions. By identifying at-risk students, schools and universities can implement timely interventions to improve retention rates and promote student success.

The system includes an end-to-end pipeline for data collection, preprocessing, predictive modeling, model interpretation, and real-time deployment, along with actionable recommendations for improving retention.

---

## **Objectives**
1. **Build an Accurate Predictor**: Develop machine learning models to predict student dropouts with a high degree of accuracy.
2. **Optimize Model Performance**: Fine-tune hyperparameters and experiment with different architectures.
3. **Interpret Model Insights**: Provide insights through visualizations to understand which factors influence dropouts.
4. **Deploy the Model**: Create a user-friendly interface for real-time dropout predictions.
5. **Generate Actionable Recommendations**: Provide strategies for preventing student dropouts based on model insights.
6. **Ensure Ethical Use**: Address potential biases and ensure that predictive analytics are used responsibly.
7. **Comprehensive Solution**: Provide an end-to-end pipeline, including guidelines for system maintenance.

## **Hypotheses**
The following hypotheses are tested in this project:
1. Higher socio-economic status correlates with lower dropout rates.
2. Students with higher admission grades are less likely to drop out.
3. Dropout rates are lower among students receiving financial aid or scholarships.

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project includes information about students such as socio-economic background, academic performance, financial aid, and other personal attributes. It can be downloaded from the [3Signet](https://3signet.com/) platform.

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for modeling)
- Streamlit (for deployment)
- Git (for version control)

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dropout-prediction-project.git
cd dropout-prediction-project
```

### **Create Virtual Environment**
```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Install Additional Libraries**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow streamlit
```

## **Data Preprocessing**

### **Steps**
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
2. **Data Transformation**: Normalize numerical features and encode categorical features.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform correlation analysis and hypothesis testing.

For more details on data preprocessing, refer to the `notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb`.

---

## **Modeling**

### **Models Used**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks (using TensorFlow or PyTorch)

The models are trained on the cleaned and transformed dataset, and their performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### **Hyperparameter Tuning**
We use grid search and cross-validation to fine-tune model hyperparameters for better performance.

---

## **Deployment**

### **User Interface**
The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing educational institutions to predict student dropouts in real-time.

To run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### **Features**
- Predict student dropouts based on input data.
- Display visual insights from the model (e.g., factors influencing dropouts).
- Provide recommendations to reduce dropout rates.

---

## **Usage**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the environment and install dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate results.
4. Deploy the Streamlit app using the `app.py` script.

---

## **Contributing**

We welcome contributions to enhance the performance, add new features, or improve the user interface. Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add new feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
